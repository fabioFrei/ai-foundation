#### Project Overview
The "AI Foundation Prototype" aims to simulate the operational framework of a grantmaking foundation using an AI-powered agent network. This prototype utilizes the `crewai` framework to create a dynamic environment where AI agents perform various foundational roles, from senior leadership to operational management.

#### Goals
- To demonstrate how AI can assist in automating decision-making processes in grantmaking.
- To provide a basis for discussion and further development with potential partners interested in the intersection of AI and philanthropy.

#### Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Foundation-Prototype.git
   ```
2. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```
   pip install crewai
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Ensure you have the necessary API keys configured in your environment:
   ```
   export SERPER_API_KEY='your_serper_dev_api_key'
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
   export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME='gpt-4-turbo'
   ```

#### How It Works
The system is structured around three main AI agents:
- **Board of Directors Agent:** Makes final decisions on grant funding based on set rules and recommendations.
- **Program Officer Agent:** Manages the grantmaking programs, ensuring alignment with the foundation's goals.
- **Operational Efficiency and Community Engagement Agent:** Focuses on administrative tasks and community interaction.

Each agent is equipped with custom tools for searching and data handling, facilitating a realistic simulation of a grantmaking foundation's workflow.
